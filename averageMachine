# Create a program that prints an average for a set of
# numbers:

# First, ask the user for how many numbers he would like
# to enter.

# Then ask him to input each number

# Then calculate the average and print it

print('Welcome to my average machine!')
print('Enter in how many numbers you would like to average')
print('n: ')

for i in range(n):    
    print('Please enter a number: ')

    totalSum = totalSum + usrInput

# totalSum is now all of the numbers added together

average = totalSum / n
